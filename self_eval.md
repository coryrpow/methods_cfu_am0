# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
I feel a lot more confident in using methods than the prior week. Being able to combine things from previous assignments and integrate them together feels satisfying. It's cool to reflect on how far I've come from only a few weeks of knowing absolutely nothing about coding to now!
- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
The power of using methods is their ability to be reused as many times as needed. Instead of typing out lines of code that involve logic, a method can run the same type of logic in many different uses as many times as needed.
